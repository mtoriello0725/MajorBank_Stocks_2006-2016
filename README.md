# MajorBank_Stocks_2006-2016
This is a finance project completed for the Udemy online bootcamp "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning".  Here I have created a custom script using Acaconda distribution and several of Python's popular data science packages to analyze stock prices for 6 major banks in the 10 year span from 2006-2016.
